# BERNARD

Bernard is a program committed to educating people about the anatomy of the human (and maybe not human in the next updates) body.

## How to Use

1. Input the selection you want to learn about.
2. The program will give you a description of the body part.

## Usage

You can either:
- Use a compiler on your local machine to compile and run the code.
- Use an online compiler like ONLINEGDB.

## Notice

The current version is ALPHA 0.00.
Alpha versions can be very unstable and maybe even unusable!
Use at your own risk.
